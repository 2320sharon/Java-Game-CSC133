# Java-Game-CSC133

## Summary
  A simple Java game that demonstrateges mastery of objected oriented programming and various design patterns. This game was built as project for my CSC 133 at Sacramento State. I built and designed this game from stratch as showcased by the uml diagrams included in the repository. I took care to make sure the code followed industry level coding standards and utilized design patterns used in industry. Please note the focus of this class was not graphics , but on the quality of the code.

  The gameplay has the player act as the blue ant, whose goal is to reach the 3 pink flags before they run out of food or get eaten by the spider represented as triangles. The ant can increase their food level by eating the green squares with a number representing the food that will be eaten by the ant. If the player fails to get all three flags before all three of their lives run out its game over.
